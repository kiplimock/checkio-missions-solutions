#### 1. Sum Numbers
In a given text you need to sum the numbers. Only separated numbers should be counted. If a number is part of a word it shouldn't be counted.

The text consists from numbers, spaces and english letters

**Input**: A string.

**Output**: An int.


#### 2. Even the last
You are given an array of integers. You should find the sum of the integers with even indexes (0th, 2nd, 4th...). Then multiply this summed number and the final element of the array together. Don't forget that the first element has an index of 0.



#### 3. Right to left
One of the robots is charged with a simple task: to join a sequence of strings into one sentence to produce instructions on how to get around the ship. But this robot is left-handed and has a tendency to joke around and confuse its right-handed friends.

You are given a sequence of strings. You should join these strings into a chunk of text where the initial strings are separated by commas. As a joke on the right handed robots, you should replace all cases of the words "right" with the word "left", even if it's a part of another word. All strings are given in lowercase.

**Input**: A sequence of strings.

**Output**: The text as a comma-separated string.



#### 4. Three Words
Let's teach the Robots to distinguish words and numbers.

You are given a string with words and numbers separated by whitespaces (one space). The words contains only letters. You should check if the string contains three words in **succession**. For example, the string "start 5 **one two three** 7 end" contains three words in succession.

**Input:** A string with words.

**Output:** The answer as a boolean.



#### 5. First Word
You are given a string where you have to find its first word.

When solving a task pay attention to the following points:

There can be dots and commas in a string.
A string can start with a letter or, for example, a dot or space.
A word can contain an apostrophe and it's a part of a word.
The whole text can be represented with one word and that's it.

**Input:** A string.

**Output:** A string.
